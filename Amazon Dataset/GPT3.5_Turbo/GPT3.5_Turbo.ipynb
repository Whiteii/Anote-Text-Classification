Gar-bage.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them.\n",

I am often surprised when I change batteries in a high-use device and realize how long these batteries last. They also have a nice look and when you buy a brick of them they are conveniently wrapped in bundles of 4, which makes for easy storage. They wont replace Duracell's in my high-power-drain equipment, but for everything else these are great.\n",

They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price.

I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it.

      "text: I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it.\n",

I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.\n",

But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89.\n",

I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price.

Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps.\n",

      "text: This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the \"Kids Edition\" box was not registered as a \"Kids Edition\" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the \"Kids Edition\" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a \"Kids Edition\" so it was returned.\n",

Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it.\n",

      "text: Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs\n",

I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries.
