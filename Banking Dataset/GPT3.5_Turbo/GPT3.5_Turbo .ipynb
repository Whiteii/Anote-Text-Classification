The cost of express delivery is typically higher than standard delivery due to the faster shipping time.

However, instead of a physical card, these are typically generated online or through a mobile app and can be used for online purchases or other transactions where a physical card is not required. Disposable cards are often used for added security since they can be generated with a specific spending limit or expiration date, and once the funds have been used up or the expiration date has passed, the card becomes useless. Some banks and financial institutions offer disposable cards as a feature of their regular debit or credit card products.\n",

      "\n",
      "When you play a VR game, the graphics card in your computer is responsible for rendering high-quality, immersive graphics in real-time. To do this, the graphics card needs to be powerful enough to render the game at a high frame rate (usually 90 frames per second or higher), and the card should be compatible with the VR headset you're using.\n",

      "A good VR graphics card should also support technologies like Nvidia VRWorks or AMD LiquidVR, which are designed to improve the VR experience by reducing latency and improving performance.\n",
