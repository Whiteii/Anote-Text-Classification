# Project Name

**Description:**

Student-led, this project with Anote AI tackles challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 Turbo, BERT, and RNN. LLMs face difficulty handling specific domains due to training on complex, real-world data. To boost accuracy in text classification, an active learning approach is introducedâ€”akin to providing students with clear examples for better understanding. The strategy involves fine-tuning the model through human feedback, enhancing performance in specific areas. With recent fine-tuning capabilities for GPT-3.5 Turbo and the upcoming GPT-4 release, student developers can tailor models for unique use cases. Notably, ongoing work includes implementing Claude to further augment the project's capabilities.
