# Anote-Text-Classification

We are actively engaged in developing and testing diverse models such as BERT, GPT-4, RNN, and more, with a focus on text classification predictions.

### BERT Model Implementation:
I have successfully implemented and fine-tuned a BERT model to generate predictions on the testing data sourced from the TREC dataset provided by Hugging Face. For instance, when presented with a question like "Who is Galileo?" my model strives to predict that the question pertains to an inquiry about a human.
