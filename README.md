# Enhancing Language Model Accuracy: The Power of a Few Labeled Examples

**Description:**
As student this project with Anote AI, addressing challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 Turbo, BERT, and RNN. In the early days, LLMs required extensive labeled data, posing time and cost challenges. Real-world data complexities, being messy and unstructured, made effective analysis difficult.

To overcome these hurdles, we introduce an active learning approach, enhancing text classification accuracy. Similar to providing students with clear examples for better understanding, the strategy involves fine-tuning models through human feedback or providing more label examples.
