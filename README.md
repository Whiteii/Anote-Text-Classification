# Project Name

**Description:**

This project addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, in handling specific domains due to their broad training on messy and unstructured real-world data. Acknowledging the challenges of accuracy in text classification for complicated categories, the project proposes an active learning approach. Similar to providing students with clear examples to enhance their understanding, this approach involves fine-tuning the model, incorporating human feedback to improve its performance in specific areas. With the recent introduction of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo and the upcoming release for GPT-4, developers now have the opportunity to tailor models for their specific use cases, utilizing the active learning strategy to enhance accuracy and address domain-specific challenges.
